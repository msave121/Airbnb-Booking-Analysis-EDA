### **Project Summary -**

Airbnb, which stands for "Air Bed and Breakfast," is a platform that lets owners of real estate lease out their apartments to vacationers in need of somewhere to stay.

In 2008, Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia, who were based in San Francisco, California, founded Airbnb. Both a website and a mobile app are available for the platform.

Since its launch in 2008, Airbnb has allowed both hosts and visitors to extend their travel options and offer a more distinctive, customised method of seeing the world.

Millions of listings create a vast amount of data that can be analysed and utilised for a variety of purposes, including security, business decision-making, understanding customer and provider behaviour and performance on the platform, directing marketing campaigns, and putting innovative new services into place.

EDA's primary goal is to assist in examining data before drawing any conclusions. It can assist in locating glaring errors, better understanding data patterns, spotting outliers or unusual occurrences, and discovering intriguing correlations between the variables.It can assist in identifying glaring mistakes, improving understanding of data patterns, spotting anomalies or unexpected occurrences, and finding intriguing correlations between variables.


### **Problem Statement-**

Airbnb was founded in 2008 with the goal of providing travellers and hosts with additional options for travel and a more distinctive and intimate travel experience. These days, Airbnb is a distinct service that is utilised and acknowledged globally. An essential component of Airbnb's business model is the analysis of data from millions of postings. An enormous amount of data is produced by these millions of entries.
We will be analysing data from Airbnb NYC in 2019.
Our primary study objectives span four propositions, which may be summed up as Host Learnings, Areas, Prices, Ratings, Locations, etc., but we won't stop there; we'll also aim to investigate some other concepts.
